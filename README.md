## Project Architecture

The Hospital Management System is organized around the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture, enabling a modular approach that separates application logic from user interface and data management. This architecture improves scalability and makes it easier to maintain or extend functionalities.

1. **Model Layer** – Manages the core data, business logic, and rules for handling patient records, billing, and inventory.
2. **View Layer** – Provides the user interface, presenting information in a clean, accessible way for healthcare providers and administrative staff.
3. **Controller Layer** – Handles the interaction between the Model and View layers, routing user requests and updating the interface based on the data processed.

## Key Features

- **Patient Record Management** – Stores and updates patient information for easy access.
- **Appointment Scheduling** – Enables efficient scheduling and management of patient appointments.
- **Billing and Payment Processing** – Handles billing and invoicing for medical services rendered.
- **Inventory Management** – Manages hospital inventory, including medications and medical supplies.
- **User Authentication** – Secures access to sensitive data through user login and roles.

## My Contribution

In this project, I focused on developing the backend API using Java and Spring Boot, ensuring efficient handling of patient data, appointment scheduling, and billing processes. I also contributed to the database schema design, optimizing queries to improve data retrieval speeds. Additionally, I integrated the frontend interface with the backend API, enabling a seamless user experience and efficient workflow management for healthcare professionals.
